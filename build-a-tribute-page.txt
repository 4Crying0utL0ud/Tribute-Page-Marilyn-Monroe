         <h2 id="headline">BIOGRAPHY</h2>

        <p>Marilyn Monroe was an American actress, singer and model. Famous for playing comedic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one of the most popular icons of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's sexual revolution.</p>

 <p>Norma Jean Baker, better known as Marilyn Monroe, experienced a troubled childhood that included 2 years at an orphanage. When Norma Jean, born on June 1, 1926, was seven years old, her mother, Gladys (Monroe) Baker Mortenson, was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and hospitalized. Monroe was left to a series of foster homes. She opted for an early marriage on June 19, 1942.</p>

 <p>During the war years, Monroe worked at the Radio Plane Company in California, but she was soon discovered by photographers. She enrolled in a 3-month modelling course and in 1946, aware of her considerable charm and the potential it had for a career in films, Monroe obtained a divorce. On August 26, 1946, she signed a one-year contract with the studio. Ben Lyon then suggested a new name for the actress — Marilyn Monroe.</p>

 <p>During her first year at Fox, Monroe did not appear in any films, and her contract was not renewed. In the spring of 1948 Columbia Pictures hired her for a small part in Ladies of the Chorus. In 1950 John Huston cast her in Asphalt Jungle, a tiny part which landed her a role in "All About Eve". She was given a seven-year contract with Twentieth Century Fox and appeared in "The Fireball", "Let's Make It Legal", "Love Nest" and "As Young as You Feel".</p>

 <p>In 1952, Monroe appeared in Don't Bother to Knock, Full House, Clash by Night, We're Not Married, Niagara and Monkey Business.</p>

 <p>On January 14, 1954, she married Yankee baseball player, Joe Di Maggio. But the couple soon thereafter divorced on October 27, 1954.</p>

 <p>In 1955 she formed her own studio, Marilyn Monroe Productions, and re-negotiated a contract with Twentieth Century Fox. She appeared in Bus Stop in 1956 and married playwright Arthur Miller on July 1, 1956.</p>

 <p>The couple was divorced on January 24, 1961 and later that year, Monroe entered a New York psychiatric clinic. After her brief hospitalization there she returned to the Fox studio to work on a film, but her erratic behavior betrayed severe emotional disturbance, and the studio discharged her in June 1962.</p>

 <p>Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her Los Angeles bungalow on August 5, 1962, an empty bottle of sleeping pills by her side. She was only 36 years old.</p>
